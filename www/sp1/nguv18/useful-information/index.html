            <h2>Seasons</h2>
            <div>
                <h3>Spring</h3>

                <p>Srping is the first season of the year. It is warmer than winter, but it rains lightly several days.
                    So the moisture in the atmosphere is rather high. However, in this season, we celebrate the biggest
                    holiday of the year.
                    <br>
                    Tet holiday, Tet Nguyen Dan or Lunar New Year is a biggest traditional Vietnamese celebration. If
                    you plan to visit Hanoi during spring, don't miss this holiday.A pro tip is when you see shops full
                    of people, you should buy food for at least 3 days. Because it can be the time, when everyone is
                    preparing for the Tet holiday as shops may close during this period. You can ask the local in order
                    to know the date exactly since is caclutated in lunar calendar.For an unforgetable experience, you
                    should consider celebrating Tet with locals in nearby places like Sapa or Mai Chau.
                </p>
                <h3>Summer</h3>
                <p>Summer is the hottest season of the year. It is the season to have food and drink that has light
                    taste like gỏi cuốn (spring rolls), bánh mì (Vietnamese sandwich), and chè (dessert soups). During
                    this season, it's best to head to the mountains, like Sapa, Tam Dao, or Mai Chau, to escape the
                    heat. Also, you can visit urban beaches or enjoy water parks for a refreshing experience like
                    Vinhomes Ocean Park or VinWonders Wave Park .
                    Those places are not so far from the city center.
                </p>
                <h3>Autumn</h3>
                <p>
                    Autumn in Hanoi is the most beautiful season of the year. Therefore, it is the best time to go, with
                    cool, pleasant weather and gentle sunshine. You can wear short sleeves but you should bring a light
                    jacket for the chilly mornings and late evenings. You can experience a city tour on a double-decker
                    bus or try to be a local by enjoying breakfast with a bowl of pho in the early morning , then taking
                    a motorcycle ride around the Old Quarter. And last but not least, don’t forget to stop by a café
                    with a great view.
                    <br>
                    Mid-Autumn Festival, celebrated in Vietnam and other parts of Asia, is a traditional harvest
                    festival held on the 15th day of the 8th lunar month. It’s a time for families to gather, enjoy
                    mooncakes, and admire the full moon. Children often participate in lantern processions, and various
                    cultural performances take place. The best place to enjoy Mid-Autmn Festival is Hang Ma street. The
                    whole street are full of shops with decoration. You can find the traditional toys as the most
                    mordern one in this street.

                <h3>Winter</h3>
                <p>
                    Hanoi’s winter is not as cold as in other countries. There won't shnow but are still chilly days, so
                    it's important to bring warm clothing. To stay cozy, try local delicacies like lục tào phớ (a sweet
                    tofu dessert) or bánh trôi tàu (sticky rice dumplings). If you prefer warmer weather, you can visit
                    south to escape the cold.
                    <br>
                    Christmas is not our main holdiay, but we also decorate accoridng to the Christmas theme. You can
