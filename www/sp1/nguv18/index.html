            <h2> Basic information about Hanoi</h2>
            <p>
                Hà Nội, Hanoi, or Hanoj, is the capital and political-cultural center of Vietnam. Founded in 1010 under
                the Lý Dynasty by Lý Công Uẩn (Lý Thái Tổ), Hanoi has more than a thousand years of history with many
                ups and downs. The city is located on the banks of the Red River, and it has a favorable location that
                connects with other regions in the country. Not only is it a place that records valuable cultural and
                historical heritages, but Hanoi is also the heart of the country, where tradition and modernity blend
                harmoniously.

            <h2>Why visit Hanoi?</h2>
            <p>
                Hanoi is a city that should be on your travel list if you’re looking for a blend of rich history,
                vibrant culture, and unforgettable experiences.
                Walking around Hanoi’s Old Quarter, you’ll encounter the bustling charm of narrow streets lined with
                French colonial architecture alongside modern buildings.
                Hanoi’s cuisine is a must-try for food lovers. You’ll quickly find spots serving phở, bún chả, or bánh
                mì—iconic dishes you can’t miss when visiting the city.
                Beyond the main meals, you can enjoy egg coffee in a quiet corner by West Lake in the late morning or
                indulge in snacks like bánh giò or cháo sườn before dinner.

                Hanoi also has peaceful moments besides the hustle and bustle of life.
                During the autumn days, enjoying a walk around the ancient Temple of Literature or relaxing by West Lake
                at sunset can make you fall in love with this city before you realize it.
                Hanoi is a city of contrasts, where modern life seamlessly intertwines with tradition and every street
                corner has its own story to tell.
