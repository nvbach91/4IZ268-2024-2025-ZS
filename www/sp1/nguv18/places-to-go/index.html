            <h3>Hanoi's Old Quarter</h3>
            <div class="container">
                <p class="text-left">
                    Old Quarter is the center of Hanoi. Sometimes, it is even called the name Hà Nội 36 phố phường (36
                    old quarters). The streets are named uniquely after the specific goods that they sold in the past.
                    For instance, Hang Bac was known for silver crafting, or Hang Muoi for salt. While some roads have
                    preserved their traditional crafts, others have adapted to modern life.
                    Some part of the Old Quarter's architecture, influenced by late 19th-century French styles, features
                    1-2 story houses with moss-covered red-tile roofs, creating a nostalgic and poetic atmosphere.

                <img src="./img/hoang-thanh.jpg" alt="The Imperial Citadel of Thang Long">
                <p class="text-right">
                    The Imperial Citadel of Thang Long (Hoàng thành Thăng Long) is an iconic structure built in 1010
                    during the Ly Dynasty. It is a significant architectural and historical achievement, initiated by Ly
                    Cong Uan (Ly Thai To) immediately after he moved the capital of Dai Viet (old Vietnam) from Hoa Lu
                    to Thang Long. Over various dynasties, the citadel was continuously expanded and developed, serving
                    as a center of power for over a millennium.

            <h3>Hoan Kiem lake</h3>
            <div class="container">
                <p class="text-left">
                    Hoan Kiem Lake ( Hồ Hoàn Kiếm), also called Hồ Gươm or "Bờ Hồ" by locals and located in the heart of
                    the capital, is an iconic symbol of Hanoi deeply rooted in the city's history and culture. The lake
                    is tied to the legend of King Le Loi returning a sword to the Golden Turtle, symbolizing patriotism
                    and peace.
                    <br>
                    Beside the Turtle Tower (Tháp Rùa), Ngoc Son temple is a historic and spiritual landmark dedicated
                    to General Tran Hung Dao, a revered Vietnamese hero. Accessible via the iconic The Huc Bridge, it
                    offers a serene escape amidst the bustling city.
                    <br>
                    Beyond its historical significance, Hoan Kiem Lake is a place where tradition and modern life mix.
                    Whether at sunrise or under the glow of city lights, its serene atmosphere provides a peaceful
                    retreat from the bustling streets. It’s also a place where locals gather to exercise or enjoy the
                    view of Hoan Kiem Lake, reflecting the unique rhythm of life in Hanoi.

                    A key feature of the temple is the Doctors' Stelae, 82 stone tablets on turtle backs, recording the
                    names of scholars from 1442 to 1779. These stelae honor academic excellence and inspire future
                    generations to value learning and dedication.
                    <br>
                    Nowadays, Khue Van Cac (the picture) is chosen as a symbol of Hanoi.
