            <h4>Phở</h4>
            <p class="pho-main">
                A must-try dish when visiting Hanoi is Pho, one of Vietnam's most beloved breakfast foods. Each region
                in Vietnam has its unique way of preparing and serving it, but the Hanoi version is something you cannot
                miss.
            </p>

            <div class="container-pho">
                <div class="images-pho">
                    <img src="./img/pho-ha-noi-banner.jpg" alt="Pho Bo">

                <div class="pho">
                    <h5>Phở bò</h5>
                    <p class="pho-text-right">
                        Phở bò Hà Nội (Hanoi beef pho) consists of pho, broth, beef, and herbs. Unlike pho in Saigon,
                        Hanoi pho is not served with fresh herbs (rau sống). The beef is typically either rare or
                        well-done. A bowl of beef pho is never complete without the crispy quẩy (fried dough). Here are
                        a few of my favorite pho spots:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Phở Long Bích:
                            <br>
                            1. 121 Tam Trinh street
                            <br>
                            2. 96 Võ Thị Sáu street
                            <br>
                            3. 6 Bằng Liệt street
                        </li>
                        <li> Phở Anh Béo: the intersection of Nguyen Khac Hieu Street and Tran The Xuong Street, near
                            Truc Bach Lake.
                        </li>
                    </ul>


                    <h5>Phở gà</h5>
                    <p class="pho-text-right">
                        Besides phở bò, you can also enjoy phở gà (chicken pho). Similar to phở bò, phở gà is served
                        with
                        the addition of lime leaves(lá chanh) – a must-have when eating with boiled chicken.
                        Here are a few of my favorite spots:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Phở gà Vân Thủy: 168 Lò Đúc street </li>
                        <li> Phở Gà Ta Hương: 35 Tô Hiến Thành street </li>
                        <li> Phở gà bún thang Thủy: 22 Nam Tràng street </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

            <h4>Bún chả</h4>
            <div class="container">
                <p class="text-left">
                    This is a must-try lunch in Hanoi. It is served with Nem rán(spring rolls) and fresh herbs. I would
                    recommend you try it in a street food vendor - one of the traditional things in Vietnam.
                    <br>
                    To try the old taste of Bún chả Hà Nội, you should come to Bún chả que che: 16A Nguyễn Khắc Nhu
                    Street.
                </p>

            <h4>Bún thang</h4>
            <div class="container">
                <img src="./img/bunthang-3053.jpg" alt="Bun thang">
                <p class="text-right">
                    Bún thang is a dish unique to Hanoi. You can find it in some small restaurant that have phở gà.
                    <br>
                    My recommedation is Phở gà bún thang Thủy: 22 Nam Tràng street
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3>Snack</h3>
            <div class="container">
                <p class="text-left">
                    Besides typical main dishes, Hanoi people love snacks so much. It is not an official tradition, but
                    parents often buy them light snacks after picking up kids from school. Apart from the traditional
                    snacks such as Cháo sườn, Quẩy, Bánh rán,... Several new snacks worldwide, like Takoyaki, Hawker
                    Star, Donuts, and Kebab, are imported to Hanoi. Also, Vietnamese snacks are often in small sizes, so
                    they won't affect your meal.
                </p>

                <img src="./img/cafe-trung-ha-noi-08-1697236136.jpg" alt="Coffee">
                <p class="text-right">
                    As well as snacks, there are plenty of options for drinks in Hanoi. Vietnam is famous for coffee,
                    and it has reached another level. It is not much when everyone says that you can't sleep if you
                    drink Vietnamese in the afternoon. An Alternative option is egg coffee. It is a unique type of
                    coffee that you should try.
                    <br>
                    Besides that, you can have several options like fresh bia (bia hơi), dracontomelon juice (nước sấu),
                    sugar cane juice (nước mía), or sidewalk iced tea (trà đá vỉa hè).

                <p class="text-left">
                    Water puppets are a traditional Vietnamese art form performed on a water-filled stage in the 11th
                    century. Each sense tells stories from rural life and folklore. The puppets are controlled by
                    skilled puppeteers standing behind a screen, with music and narration enhancing the performance.
                    It’s a unique cultural experience and a must-see for visitors to Hanoi.
