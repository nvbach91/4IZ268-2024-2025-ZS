                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>
                        I grew up in a charming and close-knit village near Sedlčany, a place that profoundly shaped my
                        personality and values.
                        The simplicity and sense of community in my hometown instilled in me a deep appreciation for the
                        little things in life
                        and a strong work ethic. Growing up surrounded by nature and traditional values gave me a solid
                        foundation to explore
                        the world beyond my village.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After completing five years of elementary school, I transitioned to a gymnasium. My years there
                        were transformative,
                        as I developed a love for learning and excelled across various subjects. I enjoyed the
                        intellectual challenges and
                        opportunities to grow, which solidified my passion for education and personal development.
                        Teachers and peers often
                        recognized me as a curious and diligent student, always eager to delve deeper into any topic.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With a strong academic background, I decided to pursue psychology at a prestigious university in
                        Mannheim. However,
                        during my first semester, I experienced a shift in my perspective. I began questioning whether
                        this path truly aligned
                        with my long-term aspirations. Though I had a genuine interest in understanding human behavior,
                        I realized that my
                        ambitions lay elsewhere. This realization marked a significant turning point in my life,
                        teaching me the value of
                        self-reflection and adaptability.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Eager to explore new avenues, I enrolled at CVUT in Prague. Despite my enthusiasm, this chapter
                        was marked by challenges.
                        The technical focus of the institution proved to be a poor fit for my skills and interests.
                        While I didn’t succeed
                        academically, this experience was far from a failure. It taught me resilience, the importance of
                        finding the right
                        environment, and the courage to pivot when something isn’t working.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Eventually, I found my true calling at VŠE, where I finally felt a sense of belonging and
                        purpose. The supportive
                        environment, engaging curriculum, and dynamic community provided me with the tools and
                        inspiration to thrive. VŠE became
                        more than just a university—it became a place of personal growth and self-discovery. It helped
                        me refine my goals,
                        develop practical skills, and build lifelong connections. The lessons I’ve learned here have
                        been invaluable, shaping
                        me into the person I am today.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Looking back, my journey has been anything but linear, but every step has contributed to my
                        growth. The experiences of
                        success, failure, and rediscovery have taught me to embrace change and remain steadfast in the
                        pursuit of what truly matters.
