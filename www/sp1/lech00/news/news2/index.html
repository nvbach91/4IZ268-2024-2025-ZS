            <h1>Rappa Guide - No Dazzle, No Break</h1>

            <article>
                <p>Mastering <a href="../../characters/Rappa/">Rappa</a> in <strong>Honkai Star Rail</strong> can be a
                    challenge, but with the "No Dazzle, No Break" strategy, you can maintain control and precision. This
                    guide provides tips, strategies, and essential knowledge to master Rappa in even the toughest
                    battles.</p>

                <h2>üåÄ What Does "No Dazzle, No Break" Mean?</h2>
                <p>The phrase "No Dazzle, No Break" refers to a playstyle where you avoid relying on flashy, unnecessary
                    moves (no dazzle) and avoid over-extending or forcing risky plays that might disrupt your team's
                    rhythm (no break). This strategy promotes efficiency, control, and calculated decisions rather than
                    risky, high-damage attempts.</p>

                <h2>üéâ Key Mechanics for Rappa</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Energy Management:</strong> Avoid using abilities that drain energy needlessly.
                        Prioritize moves that provide consistent value.</li>
                    <li><strong>Positioning:</strong> Keep Rappa in a safe but effective spot on the field. This
                        minimizes risks while maximizing contributions to the team.</li>
                    <li><strong>Buff Management:</strong> Take advantage of team buffs rather than attempting to solo
                        fights. Synergize with characters that can enhance Rappa's attacks.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>‚öôÔ∏è Key Abilities & How to Use Them</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Core Ability:</strong> Use Rappa's core ability to apply sustained pressure. Focus on
                        abilities that deal consistent damage rather than flashy, high-damage attacks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Special Skills:</strong> Prioritize skills that don't force you into recovery frames or
                        long cooldowns. Efficiency is key in this strategy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ultimate Move:</strong> Use Rappa's ultimate as a finishing move rather than an opener.
                        This guarantees you finish strong, not wasting potential damage.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>üó∫Ô∏è Best Team Compositions</h2>
                <p>Rappa works best in teams that focus on synergy, buffs, and consistent pressure. Here are some
                    recommended team setups:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Support Healer:</strong> Include a healer to keep Rappa in the fight for as long as
                        possible.</li>
                    <li><strong>Buffer/Debuffer:</strong> Characters that buff attack or debuff enemies help Rappa
                        maintain control.</li>
                    <li><strong>Defender/Tank:</strong> Protect Rappa from incoming damage, allowing him to stay focused
                        on precise, controlled attacks.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>üìú Advanced Tips & Tricks</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Don't Spam Abilities:</strong> Spamming flashy moves will leave you vulnerable. Plan
                        each move with intent.</li>
                    <li><strong>Focus on Consistent Pressure:</strong> Apply constant, reliable pressure instead of
                        going for flashy, risky plays.</li>
                    <li><strong>Master Cooldown Timing:</strong> Make sure you understand the cooldowns of each ability
                        so you never get caught in a vulnerable state.</li>
                    <li><strong>Don't Overcommit:</strong> Stick to the plan and avoid taking unnecessary risks that
                        could "break" the flow of the battle.</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="highlight">
                    <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> "No Dazzle, No Break" is a philosophy, not just a strategy. By staying
                        disciplined, you'll master Rappa's potential and outperform players who rely on flashy moves and
                        risky plays. Stay focused, stay efficient, and watch your victories pile up!</p>
