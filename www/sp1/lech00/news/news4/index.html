                    provide a detailed overview of Lingsha's abilities, team compositions, and optimal strategies to
                    maximize her potential.</p>

                <h2>üåÄ Who is Lingsha?</h2>
                <p>Lingsha is a powerful character known for her unique elemental abilities and strong synergy with
                    certain team compositions. Her playstyle revolves around precise timing and tactical
                    decision-making, making her a key player for advanced strategies.</p>

                <h2>üéâ Key Abilities & Skills</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Core Ability:</strong> Lingsha's core ability revolves around elemental damage, allowing
                        her to deal consistent AoE (Area of Effect) damage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Special Skill:</strong> Her special skill can inflict burning effects on enemies,
                        dealing damage over time while also applying debuffs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ultimate Ability:</strong> Lingsha's ultimate is a game-changer, dealing massive
                        elemental burst damage and cleansing debuffs from allies.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>‚öôÔ∏è Best Team Compositions</h2>
                <p>To fully utilize Lingsha's potential, you'll want to pair her with characters who can amplify her
                    abilities or provide support in key areas. Here are some recommended team compositions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Burn Synergy Team:</strong> Pair Lingsha with characters who can trigger elemental
                        reactions or extend burn effects.</li>
                    <li><strong>Buffer/Support Team:</strong> Characters that can buff Lingsha's damage or heal the team
                        to sustain longer battles work best.</li>
                    <li><strong>Elemental Burst Team:</strong> Synergize with characters who can generate energy for
                        Lingsha to spam her ultimate ability.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>üìú Pro Tips & Advanced Strategies</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Maximize Burn Duration:</strong> Use Lingsha's abilities to apply burn effects on as
                        many enemies as possible, as burn damage scales over time.</li>
                    <li><strong>Timing is Key:</strong> Use Lingsha's ultimate at critical moments to clear waves of
                        enemies or deal a decisive blow to bosses.</li>
                    <li><strong>Build for Consistency:</strong> Prioritize builds that increase Lingsha's elemental
                        damage and energy recharge to keep her abilities active.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> To master Lingsha, focus on timing her abilities and utilizing her burn
                    effects for maximum impact. Pair her with synergistic allies to dominate even the toughest battles.
                    Proper strategy and timing will set you apart as a master of the **Burning Scent of Home**!</p>
