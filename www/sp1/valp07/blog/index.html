                <h2>Neumorphism</h2>
                <p>By Petr Valach on December 8, 2024</p>
            </header>
            <p>Neumorphism, a design trend that emerged in recent years, has captured the attention of designers
                worldwide. It's a subtle yet effective technique that adds depth and dimension to user interfaces.</p>

            <p><em>What is Neumorphism?</em></p>

            <p>Neumorphism, also known as soft UI design, is a design style that creates the illusion of
                three-dimensionality through subtle use of light and shadow. It's a departure from the flat design trend
                that preceded it, offering a more tactile and realistic look and feel.</p>

            <p>The Origins of Neumorphism
            <p>

            <p>While the exact origins of neumorphism are somewhat unclear, it's believed to have been inspired by the
                work of Raphael Laurenti, a designer who experimented with soft, rounded shapes and subtle lighting
                effects.</p>

                <h2>Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit Amet</h2>
                <p>By Petr Valach on December 8, 2024</p>
            </header>
            <p>Have you ever wondered about the strange, nonsensical text often used as placeholder text in design
                layouts?</p>

            <p>That's lorem ipsum. It's a placeholder text commonly used to visualize the design and layout of a
                document or webpage before actual content is added.</p>

            <p><em>But where does it come from?</em></p>

            <p>The exact origins of lorem ipsum are shrouded in mystery, but it's believed to have its roots in the 15th
                century. A printer named Lorem Ipsum used the text as filler for a book of type specimens. The text
                itself is derived from a Latin text, possibly Cicero's "De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (On the Ends of
                Good and Evil).</p>

            <p>Over time, the text has been adapted and modified, but the core remains the same: a jumble of Latin words
                that doesn't actually mean anything.</p>
