            <h2>Hi, welcome to my personal website.</h2>
            <p>It was created for a school project and mostly serves as platform to self-advertise as well as a
                repository for links to useful resources and services I find myself using.</p>

            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I am a student at Prague University of Economics and Business, currently I'm in the last year of my
                bachelor's degree, or at least I hope.</p>
            <p>Before going to Uni I studied at a grammar school but I always knew I wanted to study computer science. I
                took as many elective courses as I could and made some Android apps using Kotlin in my free time.
            </p>
            <p>When I am not sudying I spend most of my time playing videogames and reading about history. I guess it is
                no surprise then that I mostly gravitate towards grand strategy games.</p>
