                        Skills are player attributes which are leveled up through the use of specific tools or actions,
                        or by reading Books. Each skill has ten levels. A skill level increase is awarded immediately
                        upon earning enough experience points (XP) for a new level, and is immediately displayed on the
                        skills tab of the inventory. The first time the player levels up a skill on each day, they are
                        notified with "You've got some new ideas to sleep on." The new skill level immediately increases
                        the proficiency of the tool(s) associated with that skill.
                        Overnight, after the player goes to bed on the day a skill level increases, a popup announces
                        the increase, and additionally awards knowledge of any applicable crafting or cooking recipes.
                        At level 5 and level 10, players also select which one of two available Professions to
                        specialize in.

                            Foraging is the skill associated with gathering wild resources found on the ground
                            throughout Stardew Valley, and with chopping down Trees. Foraging skill also increases by
                            harvesting crops grown from Wild Seeds. Most forageables can be found throughout their
                            season. One exception is Salmonberry, which can be found only during Salmonberry Season
                            (Spring 15-18) on bushes around town. Blackberries can be found on the ground during Fall,
                            but during Blackberry Season (Fall 8-11) they can also be found on bushes throughout town.

                        <p class="skill-description">
                            Combat is the skill associated with fighting monsters, such as in The Mines or the Skull
                            Cavern. Combat experience is increased by killing monsters, with more difficult monsters
                            granting more experience. It can also be gained by reading the Combat Quarterly or Book Of
                            Stars. Each increase in Combat Level adds 5 HP (health points) to the player's health meter,
                            with the exceptions of levels 5 and 10. Health points are only increased when levelling up
                            to levels 5 or 10 if the Fighter and Defender professions are chosen. Level-ups may also add
                            Crafting or Cooking recipes. Unlike other skills, there is no proficiency effect from this
                            skill since weapons do not require energy.
