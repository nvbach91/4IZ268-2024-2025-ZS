                        Stardew Valley is a relaxing game in which you inherit a farm and pursue an idealistic life in
                        the country. You can plant various crops and take care of barnyard animals. There is a wide
                        range of loveable characters to meet and befriend along the way as well. Despite the game being
                        quite laidback, running a farm can be challenging. You only have a limited amount of time and
                        energy each day. Alongside this, there are plenty of challenges and goals to strive for.
                        Fortunately, there are plenty of hidden tips and tricks to help make farming life all that more
                        enjoyable.

                        <p class="tt-description">
                            Typically, your level of friendship with each person will deteriorate if you do not speak to
                            them every day. Fortunately, the game's friendship mechanic does make things easier for you.
                            Once you reach ten hearts – or eight hearts for a marriage candidate NPC, their friendship
                            points will never go down. So, as soon as you max out a friendship, you no longer need to
                            worry about checking in all the time. You've got some permanent friendships for years, even
                            if you hardly speak to them again. With this in mind, focusing on just one or two neighbors
                            at a time can be a valuable strategy. You can focus on maxing out their hearts before moving
                            on to someone new.

                        <p class="tt-description">
                            As you progress through Stardew Valley, you eventually unlock more areas you can make the
                            most of, from the Spa to Ginger Island. It is possible to put down objects in these
                            different parts of town. For example, you can add artisan machines along your frequent
                            routes out of your farm or perhaps give the quarry an additional purpose beyond a source of
                            rocks and geodes. You can also decorate areas with paths and other trinkets to make the town
                            fit your desired style. Getting creative with decorating the town can be a fun way to spend
                            the winter when you don't have to worry about your crops as much. The only thing you have to
                            be wary of is the walk paths of NPCs. If you avoid blocking their routes, you can build
                            almost anywhere without it being destroyed.

                        <p class="tt-description">The Skull Cavern is a difficult challenge, so you don't want to rush
                            in. Ensure you are prepared for it by taking note of a few Stardew Valley tricks that'll
                            help. For example, the day before you visit the cavern, you'll want the right equipment,
                            including a decent weapon and your trusty pickaxe already in your inventory. You'll also
                            want many bombs, food, and ladders to navigate the different levels. On the day, you'll want
                            to maximize your limited time there. A Warp Totem: Desert will ensure you can start mining
                            first thing in the morning. Don’t worry about passing out after 2 am, as you’ll quickly earn
                            back the money you lose. You’ll also want to check your fortune on the television, as it's
                            far more beneficial to go to the cavern on lucky days to gain the best loot.

                        <p class="tt-description">There are multiple places to go for relaxing fishing sessions in
                            Stardew Valley, such as the river or the ocean. Each location has its benefits and will have
                            a preferred season for you to go fishing there. Of all the options, it is best to go to the
                            mountain lake, no matter the season. Most of the fish here can be caught between 6 am and 7
                            pm, giving you a pretty big timeframe to work with. Although you won't be able to get every
                            single type of fish at the mountain lake, you will get a nice variety throughout the
                            seasons, with a few consistent fish to catch all year round, such as Carp and the Largemouth
                            Bass. The main benefit of the mountain lake is that you are far less likely to pick up
                            random trash items; this means that you are wasting less energy during your fishing trip.

                        <p class="tt-description"> This next Stardew Valley hint is all about efficiency. You only have
                            a set amount of time each day to complete all of your chores and complete any objectives you
                            might have. Because of this, you'll want to save as much time as possible whenever you can.
                            When you start a new day, have a plan of action and try and focus on just those tasks. It's
                            a good idea to study the map and get to grips with all the key locations. This will ensure
                            you aren't heading in the wrong direction at any point and wasting those precious minutes.
                            You can also complete tasks in specific orders to ensure you aren't going back and forth all
                            day.

                        <p class="tt-description">Tappers are a great way to produce maple syrup, oak resin, pine tar,
                            and sap. You need to reach Foraging level three, and then you can craft them with wood and
                            copper bars. Since you can place these on any tree, it is a great idea to make use of the
                            trees away from your farm. With the Tappers out of the way, you can do whatever you want
                            with the trees on your actual farm. A great alternative location for your tappers is the bus
                            stop just outside your farm. These trees are out of the way but still within easy reach for
                            harvesting. The trees will always be there, giving you a reliable source to tap from.</p>

                        <p class="tt-description">One of the most essential methods of progression in Stardew Valley is
                            the rebuilding of the Community Center. To do so, you must complete all of the bundles to
                            unlock new items and other valuable rewards. These bundles list things you need to track
                            down and find to achieve them. An excellent way to ensure you don't accidentally sell or
                            discard a required item is available in the inventory screen. There is a Community Center
                            icon to the right of your inventory that you can select to go to the bundles. Keep an eye on
                            this icon when you are browsing through your inventory. When you hover over an item needed
                            for a bundle, this icon will begin to glow. It is a subtle clue, so keep checking the icon
                            to ensure you don't miss out on completing any bundles.</p>

                        <p class="tt-description">Once the bus is restored, you must wait until Pam is ready to drive.
                            She arrives at the bus stop around 10 am, meaning you can't get to the desert by bus any
                            earlier. However, if you wait around Pam's home before she leaves, you can stand in the way
                            of her usual route. After a few seconds of being blocked, she becomes frustrated and runs to
                            the bus stop. With Pam ready sooner, you will now have a little extra time to spend
                            exploring the Skull Cavern. This is one of the simpler but still useful tips for Stardew
                            Valley beginners. </p>

                            unlock the Parrot Express. This is a fast-travel system that lets you quickly visit each
                            area of the island. If you happen to have the horse flute, you'll be able to summon your
                            horse to be by your side on Ginger Island. When your horse has arrived, you can hop on and
                            then enter a Parrot Express hut! Both you and your horse will be transported together,
                            ensuring that nobody is left behind.</p>

                            farmhouse, but if this doesn't suite your needs, then you can simply move it somewhere else.
                            By speaking to Robin, you can open the building option menu; at the bottom of this, there is
                            an icon you select to move buildings around. When pressing this, you'll see a zoomed-out map
                            of your farm. From here, just select the shipping bin! If you need more than one, you will
                            also be able to add extra bins to your farm wherever you want. </p>

                        <p class="tt-description">Scarecrows (and their equivalents, Rarecrows) are a staple in Stardew
                            Valley. They come in various styles and are incredibly useful for protecting precious crops
                            from crafty crows. Unfortunately, when you are tilling the ground around them, especially
                            with upgraded hoes that can cultivate a wide area, it will remove the scarecrow from its
                            spot. A handy workaround for this minor issue is to place pathing blocks, such as a wooden
                            floor, down on the ground first. Then, when a scarecrow is placed on top of one of these
                            blocks, it will no longer be knocked down when you are tilling nearby. It is a simple fix to
                            a tedious problem.</p>
