                <p>Gorillaz was born out of a creative partnership between Damon Albarn and Jamie Hewlett in 1998. The idea emerged during a shared flat in London, where the two envisioned a virtual band as a critique of the manufactured nature of pop music and celebrity culture. Albarn brought his musical expertise, while Hewlett, famed for his work on Tank Girl, developed the unique animated characters that would become the face of the band: 2-D, Murdoc Niccals, Noodle, and Russel Hobbs.</p>
                <p>In 2000, Gorillaz debuted with the single “Clint Eastwood,” a genre-blending track that captured global attention. The band's self-titled debut album followed in 2001, introducing the world to an innovative concept that combined music, animation, and storytelling. This groundbreaking project set the stage for Gorillaz’s future success.</p>

                <p>Following the success of their debut album, Gorillaz entered a new phase of creativity with the release of Demon Days in 2005.

Their innovative music videos and live performances, featuring holographic projections of the animated members, captivated audiences worldwide.

                <p>After a hiatus, Gorillaz returned in 2010 with Plastic Beach, a concept album tackling environmental issues and consumer culture. This project saw the band working with an eclectic mix of collaborators, including Lou Reed, Snoop Dogg, and Bobby Womack. The album’s narrative expanded the Gorillaz universe, introducing fans to the fictional Plastic Beach island.</p>
                <p>In 2011, the band released The Fall, a more intimate and experimental album recorded during their tour. Following another break, Gorillaz re-emerged in 2017 with Humanz, a vibrant, politically charged album that reflected the chaotic state of the world. The next year, The Now Now offered a more personal and stripped-down sound, showcasing the band’s ability to adapt and evolve.</p>
